# phylogenetic-incongruence
Adapting script from https://github.com/blab/siv-cst/blob/master/figures/main-text/F1-recombination.ipynb in order to apply to my set of ML trees. 

(Apologies I did not know how to fork a single file (or even if that is possible) so I've just linked to the original here.
